    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

GripGroundMonitorClient.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with

    This is the main application source file.
